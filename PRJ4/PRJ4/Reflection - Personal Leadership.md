#### Note: the weeks before their was not much to reflect to.


## Week 4
- Its good that we prepared the questions before for the canon meeting.
- I also like that we first made the questions our selves and then meeted to discuss what everyone came up with.
- I think the python beginner course was also very helpful for my data science skills.
- The questions: [[Research questions - investigative ability]].

## Week 5
- we met on Monday and Friday.
- We planned on Monday whats happening for this week.
- Discussed  on Friday how the progress went.
-  I think the two questions I worked myself on this week were nice and i think i made good progress individually but also as group.

## Week 6
- I think this was an OK week.
- We didn't do that much except for thinking about the data and discussing it but i think this is important especially at the beginning of an eda.
- Mainly we discussed what to keep and what not in our data.

## Week 7
- So this week we met the other groups at canon .
- We felt that we might be lacking a bit compared to the other groups regarding eda.
- I think we are on the right path though.
- It was also interesting to see the printers in action
- Our work is also going well i think.

## Week 8
- I think this week we made great progress in understanding the core features of our project.
- We are feeling confident for our EDA.
- we just need to figure out how to feed this information for a model what model we use and so on.
- Additionally we need to figure out if what we have is enough to create a model did we get the most information out of our eda.

## Week 9
- I think that we are doing well this week we started off by continuing where we left off last week with the errors.
- we have specifically looked more into filter flow regarding errors which I think is essential for finding the core features later on.
- I think we have also found an important feature with the first error vs following error thing.

## Week 10
- We used this week mainly for planning how to develop our model .
- We talked about regression vs classification and the different models.
- I think its a good think we took our time to plan this correctly.

## Week 11
- We started developing the model this week and came up with a first solution 
- We are feeling confident and I think its good we took our time before to plan.
- we are looking at good results.

## Week 12
- When we received feedback we realized we had leakage which is something we werent really thinking of that much and atm its kind of hard to understand what features causes leakage and which dont..
- So we decided to take our time to try and understand this.
- We took a step back and decided to look at where we are doing wrong.
- We decided for this week that everyone kind of just works on their own solution and then we discuss it. 
- Not that sure about this approach.
