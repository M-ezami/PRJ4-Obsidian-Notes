- What is the definition of an error?
- What about the outliers?
- Should we clean the data before the eda

## Week 5
- Is their any obvious correlations between any of the features and the error time stamps?
- Is their any obvious correlations between filter flow and the error time stamps?

## Week  6
- What do we want to keep?
- Do we want to keep the outliers?
- Do we want to keep the negative values?

## Week  7
 - Is their a correlation between specific features and the errors?
 - This is basically the main question for this week for us in our EDA.

## Week 8
- What of these previous created graphs in the last week are useful for us?
- If it is filter flow then how can we furthe prove this?


## Week 9 
- how do we want to implement the fact or feature that there are following errors and that they are different from first errors?
